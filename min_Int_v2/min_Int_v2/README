* main.py
  - script that triggers mincut, training, etc.

* /data/
  - edge_weight.txt
      file that stores edges as well as the weight assigned for each edges
       par, child, weight     form
  - insurance.csv
       data file that contains 5,000 data examples
  - vdic.npy
       numpy dictionary that stores states for each variable
  (The following files are not used)
  - insurance.bif
       a .bif file that include the BN structure and true CPTs
  - insurance.net
       a .net file that include the BN structure and true CPTs
  - insurance.dat
       certain format of data in .dat format that may be used for SAMIAM
       
* model/bn.py   uses bnlearn library for model constrution, inference, learning
  - include functions that load csv dataset, build BN from a .bif file,
    build a BN from a list of edges, save and load a BN model.
  - parameter learning MLE from data
  - inference given evidences
  - save CPTs into JSON, visualize BN structure, etc.

* graph/mincut.py   finds a mincut
  - finds a minimum cut on a G
  - remove a list of edges from G
  - run atomic intervention on a set of nodes in G

* graph/utils.py    utils
  - build a networkx DAG from /data/edge_weight.txt file
